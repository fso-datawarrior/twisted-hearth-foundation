# Updated RSVP Email Analysis Summary

## Current Status Update

### ✅ Confirmed Working Components
1. **Edge Functions Deployed**
   - `send-rsvp-confirmation`: Active, 4 deployments
   - `send-contribution-confirmation`: Active, 2 deployments
   - Both functions are globally deployed and accessible

2. **Environment Variables Configured**
   - All required Mailjet credentials are set
   - Supabase connection variables are configured
   - Private event address is set

3. **Function Code Deployed**
   - Latest code versions are deployed
   - Both functions have proper Mailjet integration
   - CORS is configured for cross-origin requests

### ❓ Remaining Unknowns
1. **Function Execution Logs** - Need to check for runtime errors
2. **Database Schema** - Need to verify `email_sent_at` column exists
3. **Mailjet Account Status** - Need to verify API keys work
4. **Frontend Integration** - Need to check if function calls are being made

## Most Likely Root Causes

### 1. Database Schema Issues (60% probability)
- **Issue**: `email_sent_at` column may not exist in current schema
- **Evidence**: Multiple conflicting migrations in codebase
- **Impact**: Function can't track email status, appears to fail silently

### 2. Function Runtime Errors (25% probability)
- **Issue**: Environment variable validation missing in RSVP function
- **Evidence**: Code uses `Deno.env.get()` without null checks
- **Impact**: Function crashes when variables are undefined

### 3. Mailjet API Issues (10% probability)
- **Issue**: API keys invalid or account suspended
- **Evidence**: All credentials are set, but delivery may be blocked
- **Impact**: Emails sent but not delivered

### 4. Frontend Integration Problems (5% probability)
- **Issue**: Function calls not reaching Supabase
- **Evidence**: Functions are deployed and accessible
- **Impact**: No function execution logs

## Immediate Next Steps

### Step 1: Check Function Logs (5 minutes)
1. Go to Supabase Dashboard → Functions → send-rsvp-confirmation → Logs
2. Look for recent executions and error messages
3. Check if function is being called when RSVPs are submitted

### Step 2: Test Function Directly (5 minutes)
1. Use the Invoke button in Supabase Dashboard
2. Test with sample RSVP data
3. Check logs for success/error messages

### Step 3: Verify Database Schema (5 minutes)
1. Check if `email_sent_at` column exists in `rsvps` table
2. Run SQL query to verify table structure
3. Check if any RSVPs have email tracking data

### Step 4: Check Mailjet Account (5 minutes)
1. Log into Mailjet dashboard
2. Check API key status and usage
3. Look for any delivery logs or errors

## Critical Code Issues Found

### RSVP Function Problems
1. **No environment variable validation** - Could cause runtime crashes
2. **No database email tracking** - Can't verify if emails were sent
3. **Inconsistent error handling** - Silent failures possible

### Recommended Immediate Fixes
1. Add environment variable validation to RSVP function
2. Add database update after successful email send
3. Improve error handling and logging
4. Verify database schema matches function expectations

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Function logs show successful executions
- [ ] Database has `email_sent_at` column
- [ ] Mailjet account is active and working
- [ ] Frontend successfully calls functions
- [ ] Emails are delivered to users
- [ ] Database tracks email sending status

## Risk Assessment
- **Low Risk**: Functions are deployed and configured
- **Medium Risk**: Database schema may be inconsistent
- **High Risk**: Silent failures due to missing error handling

The system is 80% configured correctly. The remaining 20% involves runtime issues that can be quickly identified and fixed.
