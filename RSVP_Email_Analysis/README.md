## Quick Summary
The RSVP email system is designed to send confirmation emails when users submit or update RSVPs. The system uses:
- **Frontend**: React component in `src/pages/RSVP.tsx`
- **Backend**: Supabase Edge Functions for email sending
- **Email Service**: Mailjet API
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with email tracking columns

## Current Status
‚ùå **Emails are not being sent** - Need to verify deployment status and configuration.

## Next Steps
1. Check Supabase Dashboard for deployed functions
2. Verify environment variables are set
3. Test email function directly
4. Deploy missing components if needed
