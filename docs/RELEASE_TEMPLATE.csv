#
# FORMATTING RULES FOR AI:
# =========================
# 1. Always use lowercase for: environment, change_type, note_type, section
# 2. Use YYYY-MM-DD for dates
# 3. Leave sort_order blank if you want automatic numbering (0, 1, 2...)
# 4. Put comma-containing text in quotes: "Fixed bug in gallery, improved performance"
# 5. Use straight quotes (") not smart quotes ("")
# 6. One meta row is required; other sections are optional
# 7. Skip empty optional fields rather than using empty quotes
#
# EXAMPLE:
# ========
# section,version,release_date,environment,summary,title,description,benefit,sort_order,endpoint,change_type,component,note_type,content
