## üîÑ **Update Development Environment**

Use this prompt to sync your current changes to the development environment.

---

**Prompt:**
```
Update my development environment with current changes. Do this now.

Current branch: [CURRENT_BRANCH_NAME]

DO NOT ASK ME QUESTIONS - JUST EXECUTE THE COMMANDS!

Execute these steps immediately:
1. Run: git status
2. Check if [CURRENT_BRANCH_NAME] exists in .github/workflows/firebase-hosting-dev.yml
3. IF branch is NOT in the workflow file:
   a. Add [CURRENT_BRANCH_NAME] to the branches list
   b. Run: git add .github/workflows/firebase-hosting-dev.yml
   c. Run: git commit -m "ci: add [CURRENT_BRANCH_NAME] to dev deployment triggers"
   d. Run: git push origin [CURRENT_BRANCH_NAME]
4. Run: git add .
5. Run: git commit -m "update: sync changes to dev environment"
6. Run: git push origin [CURRENT_BRANCH_NAME]
7. Monitor: Check https://github.com/fso-datawarrior/twisted-hearth-foundation/actions
8. IF deployment fails with authentication error:
   - Report: FIREBASE_TOKEN needs refresh
   - Instruct: Update secret at https://github.com/fso-datawarrior/twisted-hearth-foundation/settings/secrets/actions

SAFETY CHECKS:
- NEVER delete files without explicit confirmation
- ALWAYS check if branch is in workflow triggers
- ALWAYS add branch to workflow if missing
- ALWAYS verify push was successful
- ALWAYS monitor deployment for errors
- ALWAYS provide recovery instructions if errors occur

Development URL: https://twisted-hearth-foundation-dev.web.app/
Repository: https://github.com/fso-datawarrior/twisted-hearth-foundation

IMPORTANT: Do NOT ask for confirmation. Do NOT ask what I want to do. Just execute the git commands and report the results. Automatically configure the workflow if needed.

## **What This Does**

1. ‚úÖ **Checks current branch** and confirms it's development branch
2. ‚úÖ **Checks git status** for uncommitted changes
3. ‚úÖ **Stages all changes** (`git add .`)
4. ‚úÖ **Commits with message** (asks for description if needed)
5. ‚úÖ **Pushes to GitHub** to trigger auto-deployment
6. ‚úÖ **Confirms development site** is updated

- üõ°Ô∏è **Status Verification:** Always checks git status before making changes
- üõ°Ô∏è **Commit Safety:** Always asks for commit message if not provided
- üõ°Ô∏è **Push Verification:** Always verifies push was successful
- üõ°Ô∏è **Deployment Confirmation:** Always confirms deployment status

---

## **Expected Result**

- **Changes committed** and pushed to GitHub
- **Branch automatically added to workflow** (if needed)
- **Development site** auto-updates: https://twisted-hearth-foundation-dev.web.app/
- **Live preview** shows latest changes
- **All changes preserved** and safely stored

---

## **Troubleshooting**

### **If "Authentication Error: Your credentials are no longer valid"**

The `FIREBASE_TOKEN` GitHub secret has expired. To fix:

1. **Generate new Firebase token locally:**
   ```bash
   firebase login:ci
   ```
   This will open a browser, log in, and give you a new token.

2. **Update GitHub Secret:**
   - Go to: https://github.com/fso-datawarrior/twisted-hearth-foundation/settings/secrets/actions
   - Find: `FIREBASE_TOKEN`
   - Click: "Update"
   - Paste: The new token from step 1
   - Save

3. **Re-run the deployment:**
   - Go to: https://github.com/fso-datawarrior/twisted-hearth-foundation/actions
   - Find the failed workflow run
   - Click "Re-run jobs"

### **If "Branch not in workflow triggers"**

The prompt should automatically fix this, but if it doesn't:
- The branch needs to be added to `.github/workflows/firebase-hosting-dev.yml`
- The prompt will detect this and add it automatically
- If manual fix needed, see SAFETY-GUIDELINES.md
