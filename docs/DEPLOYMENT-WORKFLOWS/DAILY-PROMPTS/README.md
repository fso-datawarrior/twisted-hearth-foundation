## **üéØ Daily Workflow**

```
Morning: 01-SETUP-DEV-ENVIRONMENT.md
   ‚Üì
During day: 02-UPDATE-DEV-ENVIRONMENT.md (multiple times)
   ‚Üì
Anytime: 04-SYNC-BRANCH-TO-GITHUB.md (save progress)
   ‚Üì
End of day: 03-DEPLOY-TO-PRODUCTION.md (merges to prod-2025.partytillyou.rip)
```

**Note:** We use `prod-2025.partytillyou.rip` branch for production deployments, NOT `main`. This eliminates worktree conflicts and file deletion issues.
