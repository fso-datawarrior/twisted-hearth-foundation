Use this prompt to deploy your current branch to production.

**Prompt:**
```
Deploy my current branch to production. Do this now.

Current branch: [CURRENT_BRANCH_NAME]

DO NOT ASK ME QUESTIONS - JUST EXECUTE THE COMMANDS!

Instructions:
1. Check current branch and confirm it's ready for production
2. Check git status for any uncommitted changes
3. Add all changes to git staging

9. Provide production URL when complete

SAFETY CHECKS:
- NEVER delete files without explicit confirmation
- ALWAYS check git status before making changes
- ALWAYS commit changes before merging to main
- ALWAYS verify push was successful

## **Troubleshooting**

### **If "Authentication Error: Your credentials are no longer valid"**

The `FIREBASE_TOKEN` GitHub secret has expired. To fix:

1. **Generate new Firebase token locally:**
   ```bash
   firebase login:ci
   ```

2. **Update GitHub Secret:**
   - Go to: https://github.com/fso-datawarrior/twisted-hearth-foundation/settings/secrets/actions
   - Find: `FIREBASE_TOKEN`
   - Click: "Update"
   - Paste: The new token
   - Save

3. **Re-run the deployment:**
   - Go to: https://github.com/fso-datawarrior/twisted-hearth-foundation/actions
   - Find the failed workflow
   - Click "Re-run jobs"

### **If deployment fails (other reasons):**
1. Check GitHub Actions logs: https://github.com/fso-datawarrior/twisted-hearth-foundation/actions
2. Verify Firebase project permissions
3. Ensure `firebase.json` is configured correctly

### **If changes don't appear:**
1. Wait 2-3 minutes for Firebase CDN propagation
2. Hard refresh browser (Ctrl+F5)
3. Check Firebase Console for deployment status
