## üöÄ **Deploy to Production**

Use this prompt to deploy your current branch to production.

**üìã Reference:** See `docs/DEPLOYMENT-PROD/firebase-project-configuration.md` for complete Firebase project details.

---

**Prompt:**
```
Deploy my current branch to production. Do this now.

Use my current branch.

DO NOT ASK ME QUESTIONS - JUST EXECUTE THE COMMANDS!

Instructions:
1. Run: git branch --show-current (detect current branch automatically)
2. Check git status for any uncommitted changes
3. Add all changes to git staging
4. Commit changes with descriptive message
5. Push current branch to GitHub
6. Merge current branch to prod-2025.partytillyou.rip (or push if already on prod-2025.partytillyou.rip)
7. Trigger automated production deployment
8. Monitor deployment and report success/failure
9. Provide production URL when complete

NOTE: We use 'prod-2025.partytillyou.rip' branch for production, NOT 'main'. This eliminates worktree conflicts.

SAFETY CHECKS:
- NEVER delete files without explicit confirmation
- ALWAYS check git status before making changes
- ALWAYS commit changes before merging to prod-2025.partytillyou.rip
- ALWAYS verify push was successful
- ALWAYS monitor deployment status
- ALWAYS confirm production site is updated

Production URL: https://2025.partytillyou.rip/
Repository: https://github.com/fso-datawarrior/twisted-hearth-foundation

Expected workflow: https://github.com/fso-datawarrior/twisted-hearth-foundation/actions/workflows/firebase-hosting.yml

## **Troubleshooting**

### **If "Invalid project selection" Error**

The Firebase hosting site name in `.firebaserc` doesn't match the actual Firebase Hosting site.

**Solution:**
1. **Check Firebase configuration:** See `docs/DEPLOYMENT-PROD/firebase-project-configuration.md`
2. **Verify hosting sites:** Run `firebase hosting:sites:list` (requires authentication)
3. **Update `.firebaserc`:** Ensure the site name matches the actual Firebase Hosting site
4. **Common fixes:**
   - Use `"default"` for the main production site
   - Use `"twisted-hearth-foundation-dev"` for development site
   - Verify site names in Firebase Console ‚Üí Hosting

### **If "Authentication Error: Your credentials are no longer valid"**

The `FIREBASE_TOKEN` GitHub secret has expired. To fix:

1. **Generate new Firebase token locally:**
   ```bash
   firebase login:ci
   ```

2. **Update GitHub Secret:**
   - Go to: https://github.com/fso-datawarrior/twisted-hearth-foundation/settings/secrets/actions
   - Find: `FIREBASE_TOKEN`
   - Click: "Update"
   - Paste: The new token
   - Save

3. **Re-run the deployment:**
   - Go to: https://github.com/fso-datawarrior/twisted-hearth-foundation/actions
   - Find the failed workflow
   - Click "Re-run jobs"

### **If deployment fails (other reasons):**
1. Check GitHub Actions logs: https://github.com/fso-datawarrior/twisted-hearth-foundation/actions
2. Verify Firebase project permissions
3. Ensure `firebase.json` is configured correctly

### **If changes don't appear:**
1. Wait 2-3 minutes for Firebase CDN propagation
2. Hard refresh browser (Ctrl+F5)
3. Check Firebase Console for deployment status
