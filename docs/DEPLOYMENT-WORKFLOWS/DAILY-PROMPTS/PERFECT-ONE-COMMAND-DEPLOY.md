# ðŸš€ Perfect One-Command Deploy

**The ultimate "just do it" deployment prompt**

---

## âš¡ **Perfect Prompt**

```
Deploy my current branch to production using Path B (direct deploy). 

**Project:** fso-datawarrior/twisted-hearth-foundation
**Production:** https://2025.partytillyou.rip
**Method:** GitHub Actions "Firebase Hosting (Preview & Prod)" workflow

**Steps:**
1. Check my current branch
2. Confirm it's ready for production
3. Push any uncommitted changes to GitHub
4. Use browser automation to navigate to GitHub Actions and trigger the workflow
5. Monitor deployment progress automatically
6. Verify deployment is live

**IMPORTANT:** 
- Use browser automation tools to trigger the GitHub Actions workflow
- Do NOT ask me to click any links or do manual steps
- Automate the entire process from start to finish
- Only tell me the final result

**Just do it!** ðŸš€
```
