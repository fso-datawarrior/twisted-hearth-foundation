# ðŸš€ Perfect One-Command Deploy

**The ultimate "just do it" deployment prompt**

---

## âš¡ **Perfect Prompt**

```
Deploy my current branch to production using Path B (direct deploy). 

**Project:** fso-datawarrior/twisted-hearth-foundation
**Production:** https://2025.partytillyou.rip
**Method:** GitHub Actions "Firebase Hosting (Preview & Prod)" workflow

**Steps:**
1. Check my current branch
2. Confirm it's ready for production
3. Push any uncommitted changes to GitHub
4. Provide me with the exact GitHub Actions URL to trigger the workflow
5. Monitor deployment progress once triggered
6. Verify deployment is live

**IMPORTANT:** 
- Do NOT ask me to do manual steps
- Provide the exact URL and parameters I need
- Give me the direct link to trigger the workflow
- Make it as automated as possible

**Just do it!** ðŸš€
```
