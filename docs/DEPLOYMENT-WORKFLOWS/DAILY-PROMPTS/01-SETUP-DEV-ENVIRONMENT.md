## üöÄ **Daily Development Environment Setup**

Use this prompt to set up your development environment for the day.

---

**Prompt:**
```
Set up my development environment for today. Do this now.

Current branch: [CURRENT_BRANCH_NAME]

DO NOT ASK ME QUESTIONS - JUST EXECUTE THE COMMANDS!

Instructions:
1. Check current branch and confirm it's ready for development
2. Check for any uncommitted changes and ask before proceeding
3. If I want to create a new branch, ask me:
   - What version number should we use?
   - What feature/task am I working on today?
   - Create branch name in format: [version]-dev-[feature]
4. Push the branch to GitHub
5. Set up development environment for the branch
6. Confirm development site is accessible

SAFETY CHECKS:
- NEVER delete files without explicit confirmation
- ALWAYS check if files are being used before removing them
- ALWAYS commit changes before switching branches
- ALWAYS verify git status is clean before proceeding

Development URL: https://twisted-hearth-foundation-dev.web.app/
Repository: https://github.com/fso-datawarrior/twisted-hearth-foundation

Expected workflow: Auto-deploys on push to dev branch
```
