## ðŸŽ¯ Prompt to Copy & Paste

```
I need to set up my development environment for the day. Please help me:

1. **Check Current Status:**
   - Show me what branch I'm currently on
   - Check if there are any uncommitted changes
   - Verify the current branch is up to date with origin

2. **Version & Branch Planning:**
   - Ask me if I want to increment the version number (e.g., 3.0.0 â†’ 3.1.0)
   - Ask me what I'm working on today (e.g., "email cleanup", "user dashboard", "bug fixes")
   - Create a new development branch name using the format: `[version]-dev-[feature]`
   - Examples: `3.1.0-dev-email-cleanup`, `3.0.1-dev-user-dashboard`, `3.2.0-dev-bug-fixes`

3. **Branch Management:**
   - Create and checkout the new development branch
   - Push the new branch to origin
   - Confirm the branch is properly set up

4. **Development Environment Setup:**
   - Deploy the new branch to the development site: https://twisted-hearth-foundation-dev.web.app
   - Verify the deployment was successful
   - Provide me with the development URL for testing

5. **Daily Workflow Summary:**
   - Show me the three deployment paths available:
     - **Path A (Production via PR):** PR â†’ Preview â†’ Merge â†’ Production
     - **Path B (Manual Production):** Direct deploy to production
     - **Path C (Development):** Push to dev branch â†’ Development site
   - Confirm which path I'll use for today's work

6. **Next Steps:**
   - Remind me that when I'm ready to deploy to production, I can use the "Deploy to Production" prompt
   - Show me the development site URL for immediate testing

**Project Details:**
- Repository: twisted-hearth-foundation
- Development Site: https://twisted-hearth-foundation-dev.web.app
- Production Site: https://2025.partytillyou.rip
- Branch Naming: [version]-dev-[feature]

**Current Branch Check:** Please start by showing me what branch I'm currently on and if there are any uncommitted changes.

## ðŸš¨ Troubleshooting

**If the prompt fails:**
1. Check you're in the correct repository
2. Ensure you have push permissions
3. Verify the development site is accessible
4. Check GitHub Actions for deployment status

**Common Issues:**
- **Branch already exists:** The prompt will handle this gracefully
- **Deployment fails:** Check the GitHub Actions logs
- **Site not updating:** Wait a few minutes for deployment to complete
