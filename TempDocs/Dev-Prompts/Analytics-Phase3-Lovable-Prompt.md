# Analytics Phase 3: Automation Setup - Lovable AI Prompt

## 🎯 Quick Copy-Paste Prompt for Lovable

```
Excellent verification! The analytics system is production-ready. Now complete Phase 3: Automation & Enhancement following:
TempDocs/Dev-Prompts/Analytics-Phase3-Automation-Enhancement.md

PART 1: DAILY AGGREGATION AUTOMATION (Priority: HIGH)

Option A - Edge Function Method (RECOMMENDED):
1. Create supabase/functions/daily-analytics-aggregation/index.ts with the provided code
2. Add function to supabase/config.toml:
   [functions.daily-analytics-aggregation]
   verify_jwt = false
3. Deploy the edge function to Supabase
4. Test manually: SELECT public.aggregate_daily_stats(CURRENT_DATE::TEXT);
5. Verify aggregate record created

Option B - pg_cron Method (ALTERNATIVE):
1. Execute the pg_cron setup SQL in Supabase SQL Editor
2. Schedule job to run at 1 AM UTC daily
3. Verify cron job created: SELECT * FROM cron.job;

BACKFILL HISTORICAL DATA (Optional):
Run the backfill script to aggregate last 30 days of data.

PART 2: CONTENT INTERACTION TRACKING (Priority: MEDIUM)

Verify/add explicit tracking calls for:
1. Photo views (when photo modal opens)
2. Photo likes (when like button clicked)
3. Guestbook post views
4. Vignette views

Test with query to show content interactions recorded.

PART 3: SYSTEM METRICS (Priority: LOW - Optional)

Your choice:
- Implement performance tracking (page load time, API response time)
- Skip for now (can add later if needed)

PART 4: DOCUMENTATION

1. Update PATCHES_AND_UPDATES_TRACKER_V2.md with Phase 2 completion status
2. Create docs/ANALYTICS_RUNBOOK.md with operational procedures
3. Document the automation setup

DELIVERABLES:

Provide:
1. Confirmation that daily aggregation is scheduled (cron or edge function)
2. Query result showing at least 1 daily aggregate record
3. Content interaction tracking status (with sample query results)
4. Documentation confirmation (files created/updated)
5. Final summary of what was automated

CRITICAL: Focus on Part 1 (daily aggregation) - this is the most important automation piece. Parts 2-3 are enhancements that improve the system but aren't blocking.

Report back with complete status using the testing checklist in the prompt.
