## 2) Database & RLS

**UX Designer‚Äôs Intent:**
The database is our **storybook spine**, but privacy rules differ depending on the content type. A guest‚Äôs **RSVP and scavenger hunt progress** are personal ‚Äî only they and the admins should see them. This creates a sense of safety: your RSVP is yours alone, and your hunt journey is private. By contrast, the **photo gallery is collective**: what you upload is meant to be shared with everyone, so guests can browse and celebrate together. Clear isolation for personal data and openness for community content ensures trust, fun, and scalability for future parties.

**Tasks:**

* [ ] **Core tables**:

  * `users` (profile data)
  * `rsvps` (isolated per user; 1 per guest)
  * `comments` (threaded guestbook, tied to user)
  * `photos` (uploads visible to all once approved)
  * `vignettes` (past story hooks)

* [ ] **Hunt tables** (private per user):

  * `hunt_hints` (master list, public-readable)
  * `hunt_runs`, `hunt_progress`, `hunt_rewards` (only owner + admin can read/write)

* [ ] **Tournament tables**:

  * `tournament_registrations` (per user/team entry)
  * `tournament_teams`, `tournament_matches`

* [ ] **Roles**:

  * `user_roles` table for admin gating.

* [ ] **RLS (Row-Level Security):**

  * **RSVPs & Hunt:** guests can only see/edit their own records; admins see all.
  * **Photos & Comments:** publicly readable; only owner can edit/delete their own; admin can moderate.

* [ ] **RPCs:**

  * `upsert_rsvp` (user saves their RSVP)
  * `register_team` (tournament entry)
  * `mark_hint_found` (scavenger hunt progress)

**AC:**

* Guests can only see/update their **own RSVP and hunt progress**.
* Gallery photos and comments are **shared for all guests to view** (after moderation).
* Admins have full visibility and management.

Awesome‚Äîhere are **ready-to-paste Supabase SQL snippets** that enforce exactly what you asked:

* **RSVP + Scavenger Hunt = private** (owner + admin only)
* **Gallery photos/comments = shared** (publicly readable once approved; owner/admin can manage)

I‚Äôve included an `is_admin()` helper, RLS enablement, policies for each table, and storage rules for the gallery bucket.

# üñºÔ∏è Gallery Photos ‚Äî shared (publicly viewable once approved)

on public.photos
for select

using (user_id = auth.uid() or public.is_admin());

-- Upload (insert) by the owner (or admin on behalf)
create policy "photos_insert_owner_or_admin"

on public.photos
for delete

using (user_id = auth.uid() or public.is_admin());
```

### Storage bucket (`gallery`) policies

> Supabase storage reads happen through `storage.objects`. We‚Äôll make **public read for the `gallery` bucket** (so approved items are viewable via URLs), and **owner/admin write**. You‚Äôll gate ‚Äúapproved‚Äù visibility via the **`photos.is_approved`** table when listing. (Public URLs remain accessible if someone has the link; approval controls listing.)

```sql
-- Create bucket (run in Dashboard Storage UI or via SQL rpc)
-- select storage.create_bucket('gallery', public => true);

-- Storage RLS (applies when you enable policies in Storage settings)
-- Public READ from gallery
create policy "storage_gallery_public_read"
on storage.objects
for select
to anon, authenticated
using (bucket_id = 'gallery');

-- Uploads only by authenticated users, limit to gallery
create policy "storage_gallery_user_insert"
on storage.objects
for insert
to authenticated
with check (bucket_id = 'gallery' and owner = auth.uid());

-- Update/Delete by owner or admin
create policy "storage_gallery_update_owner_or_admin"
on storage.objects
for update
to authenticated
using (bucket_id = 'gallery' and (owner = auth.uid() or public.is_admin()))
with check (bucket_id = 'gallery' and (owner = auth.uid() or public.is_admin()));

create policy "storage_gallery_delete_owner_or_admin"
on storage.objects
for delete
to authenticated
using (bucket_id = 'gallery' and (owner = auth.uid() or public.is_admin()));
```

> **Moderation flow:** Upload creates a `photos` row with `is_approved = false`. Admin toggles to `true` in the Admin UI. Public listing queries only `where is_approved = true`. (The storage object may be technically reachable if someone had the direct URL; the UI won‚Äôt surface it until approved.)

# üí¨ Comments / Guestbook ‚Äî shared (publicly readable)

--   body text not null,

--   created_at timestamptz not null default now()
-- );

alter table public.comments enable row level security;

-- Public can read approved comments
create policy "comments_public_read_approved"
on public.comments

# üèì Tournament tables (suggested defaults)

> Not strictly requested, but here‚Äôs a sensible default: **everyone can view** tournament registrations/teams (it‚Äôs fun/hype), while only **owner/admin** can modify.

# üß∞ (Optional) RPC hardening

If you‚Äôre using RPCs, set them **SECURITY DEFINER** and check `is_admin()` where appropriate:

```sql
-- Example: list all RSVPs for admin table
create or replace function public.list_rsvps_admin()
returns setof public.rsvps
language sql
stable
security definer
set search_path = public
as $$
  select * from public.rsvps
  where public.is_admin();
$$;

-- Example: upsert_rsvp that forces user_id = auth.uid()
create or replace function public.upsert_rsvp(
  p_attending boolean,
  p_guests int,
  p_notes text
) returns public.rsvps
language plpgsql
security definer
set search_path = public
as $$
declare
  v_user uuid := auth.uid();
  v_row public.rsvps;
begin
  insert into public.rsvps (user_id, attending, guests, notes)
  values (v_user, p_attending, p_guests, p_notes)
  on conflict (user_id) do update
    set attending = excluded.attending,
        guests    = excluded.guests,
        notes     = excluded.notes
  returning * into v_row;
  return v_row;
end;
$$;
```

## ‚úÖ Quick Acceptance Checklist (matches your intent)

* **RSVP + Hunt**: only owner and admin can read/write.
* **Gallery (photos/comments)**: **publicly readable** when approved; owner/admin can manage; unapproved visible to owner/admin only.
* **Storage**: gallery bucket is public-read, owner/admin write.
* **Admin**: global bypass via `is_admin()`.

Here‚Äôs a **ready-to-paste Lovable prompt** that asks it to generate the rune images with the pulsing/low-light animation behavior you described, and ties it directly into the **Scavenger Hunt mechanic** (15 hints, progress, reward modal). I‚Äôve pulled in your scavenger hunt docsso the prompt is consistent.

# ‚úÖ Lovable Prompt ‚Äî ‚ÄúScavenger Hunt Rune Hints (Pulsing, Low-Light)‚Äù

You are Lovable‚Äôs lead engineer. Replace the current scavenger hunt **hint circles** with **rune images** that have transparent backgrounds and animate with a subtle pulse.

## üé® Design Intent

* Instead of obvious glowing circles, each hint is a **subtle rune glyph** (storybook/fairytale style).
* **Pulse behavior:**

  * Very low-light glow (opacity 0.2‚Äì0.4).
  * Fade/pulse in for \~1.5s, then stay visible \~1s.
  * Fade out completely, then remain **off for 4‚Äì5s** before the cycle repeats.
* Goal: They should feel *whispered into existence*, guiding but not distracting.
* Runes must be **transparent PNG/SVG assets** so they blend with backgrounds.

## üõ†Ô∏è Implementation

1. **Assets:**

   * Generate 15 rune images (PNG or SVG, transparent background).
   * Style: twisted fairytale / occult runes, light bone-white glow with faint green tint.
   * Dimensions: \~64√ó64 px (scalable to 96√ó96).

2. **Component:**

   * `HuntRune.tsx` in `src/components/hunt/`.
   * Props: `hintKey`, `onFound`.
   * Render rune image with **Framer Motion pulse animation**:

     ```tsx
     <motion.img
       src={`/img/runes/${hintKey}.png`}
       alt=""
       className="hunt-rune absolute"
       initial={{ opacity: 0 }}
       animate={{
         opacity: [0, 0.3, 0],
         transition: { duration: 1.5, repeat: Infinity, repeatDelay: 4.5 }
       }}
     />
     ```
   * Click/hover/focus triggers `onFound(hintKey)` and reveals the text hint.

3. **Placement:**

   * Follow hunt placement spec:

     * Hero (3‚Äì4 runes in tagline area).
     * Between sections (Costumes, Feast, Vignettes).
     * Footer/background (2‚Äì3).

4. **Progress & Reward:**

   * Persist progress (localStorage or Supabase, per current config).
   * When all 15 found ‚Üí open `HuntRewardModal` with one of the reward messages from `/data/rewards.ts`.

## ‚ú® Acceptance Criteria

* [ ] Rune assets exist in `/public/img/runes/` (15 unique).
* [ ] Each rune pulses subtly; off 4‚Äì5s between pulses.
* [ ] Users can hover/click/focus to collect a rune ‚Üí hint text shows.
* [ ] Keyboard users can tab to rune hotspots (a11y).
* [ ] Finding all 15 unlocks Easter Egg modal (randomized creepy/funny text).
* [ ] Performance: runes animate at 60fps without jank.
