## 🚀 How to Use with Lovable AI

### Option 1: Run Both Phases (Recommended)
Copy this complete prompt into Lovable:

```
Execute the analytics system implementation in two phases:

PHASE 1 - DATABASE MIGRATION:
Follow the detailed instructions in TempDocs/Dev-Prompts/Analytics-Migration-Prompt.md to:
1. Execute the analytics database migration in Supabase
2. Create all 6 analytics tables with proper schemas
3. Add performance indexes and RLS policies
4. Verify everything was created successfully
5. Report back with complete status

PHASE 2 - VERIFICATION & TESTING:
After Phase 1 completes successfully, follow TempDocs/Dev-Prompts/Analytics-Verification-Testing-Prompt.md to:
1. Test database data collection
2. Verify frontend analytics integration
3. Test session tracking and page view logging
4. Validate admin dashboard displays analytics
5. Test RLS security and performance
6. Complete all success criteria checklists
7. Provide comprehensive test results

Refer to TempDocs/Dev-Prompts/Analytics-Complete-Implementation-Guide.md for overview and troubleshooting.

Take your time with each phase and verify every step - this is critical infrastructure.
```

### Option 2: Run Phase by Phase
**For Phase 1 only:**
```
Execute the analytics database migration following the detailed instructions in TempDocs/Dev-Prompts/Analytics-Migration-Prompt.md

Key requirements:
- Read supabase/migrations/20251012200000_create_analytics_tables.sql
- Execute in Supabase SQL Editor
- Verify all 6 tables, 19+ indexes, and 13+ RLS policies created
- Run all verification queries
- Report complete status
```

**For Phase 2 (after Phase 1 completes):**
```
Comprehensively test the analytics system following TempDocs/Dev-Prompts/Analytics-Verification-Testing-Prompt.md

Work through ALL tests systematically:
- Database data verification
- Frontend integration testing
- Live data collection testing
- Admin dashboard validation
- RLS security testing
- Performance testing
- Edge case testing
- Complete success checklists
```

## 📊 What Gets Implemented

### Database Tables (6)
1. **user_sessions** - Tracks user sessions with browser, device, geo data
2. **page_views** - Logs page navigation with viewport and timing
3. **user_activity_logs** - Records user actions and interactions
4. **content_interactions** - Tracks engagement with photos, posts, etc.
5. **system_metrics** - Stores performance metrics
6. **analytics_daily_aggregates** - Daily rollup for dashboard performance

### Security (RLS Policies)
- ✅ Admin-only read access on all tables
- ✅ System can insert for anonymous tracking
- ✅ System can update for session management
- 🔒 Non-admin users completely blocked

### Performance (Indexes)
- ✅ User session indexes (user_id, started_at, ended_at)
- ✅ Page view indexes (session_id, user_id, created_at, page_path)
- ✅ Activity log indexes (session_id, user_id, created_at, action_type)
- ✅ Content interaction indexes (session_id, user_id, content_id, composite)
- ✅ System metrics indexes (recorded_at, metric_type, composite)
- ✅ Daily aggregate index (date)

### Frontend Integration
- ✅ AnalyticsProvider already in App.tsx
- ✅ Session tracking with 30-minute timeout
- ✅ Automatic page view logging
- ✅ User activity tracking
- ✅ Admin dashboard widgets
- ✅ Analytics API functions

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Migration Safety
- ✅ Uses `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` - won't break existing tables
- ✅ Uses `CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS` - won't duplicate indexes
- ✅ No DROP or DELETE statements - data is safe
- ⚠️ CREATE POLICY may error if policies exist (safe to ignore)

### Data Collection
- 🔄 Starts automatically when user visits site
- 💾 Session ID stored in localStorage
- ⏱️ 30-minute timeout for inactive sessions
- 📊 Real-time tracking of page views and actions

### Security
- 🔒 Only admins can read analytics data
- ✅ Anonymous users can trigger data collection
- 🚫 Non-admin users completely blocked from reading
- ✅ Service role has full access for system operations

---

## 🐛 Quick Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| **Policy already exists** | Safe to ignore or DROP POLICY first |
| **is_admin() function not found** | Check existing migrations for function |
| **No data collecting** | Verify AnalyticsProvider in App.tsx |
| **Admin can't see data** | Add user to user_roles with 'admin' role |
| **Charts not rendering** | Check browser console for errors |
| **Session timeout not working** | Verify localStorage is enabled |
