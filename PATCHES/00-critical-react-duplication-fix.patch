## Description
This patch fixes a critical runtime error where React hooks returned null due to multiple React instances being loaded.

## Problem
The error `TypeError: Cannot read properties of null (reading 'useState')` was caused by Vite prebundling React 
separately from other dependencies, creating duplicate React instances. This violated React's single-instance requirement.

## Solution
- Excluded React and related modules from prebundling in vite.config.ts
- Maintained React deduplication configuration
- This ensures only one React instance is loaded across all dependencies

## Impact
- Fixes blank screen on app load
- Resolves all React hook-related null errors
- Ensures stable React context and state management
