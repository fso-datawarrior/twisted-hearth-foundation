  Jamie & Kat Ruth have been hosting legendary Halloween celebrations for years, 
  each more elaborate than the last. Known for their attention to detail and 
  commitment to the Halloween experience, they've transformed their home into 
  various haunted realms.
</p>
<p className="font-body text-lg mb-6 text-muted-foreground">
  This year's Alice-influenced fairytale theme promises to be their most ambitious yet, 
  complete with new vignettes, added decor and surprises around every corner. 
  Will you find your way out of Wonderland, or will you be lost in the madness forever?
