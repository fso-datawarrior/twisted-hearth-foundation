# TypeScript & React Development Standards

## Code Style
- Always use semicolons
- Use TypeScript strict mode
- Prefer functional components with hooks
- Use proper TypeScript types and interfaces

## Import Standards
- Use @/ path aliases for internal imports
- Group imports: React first, then third-party, then local
- Use named imports when possible

## Component Guidelines
- Use PascalCase for component names
- Export components as default exports
- Use proper prop typing with interfaces
- Implement proper error boundaries

## State Management
- Use React hooks (useState, useEffect, useContext)
- Prefer local state over global state when possible
- Use custom hooks for reusable logic

## Error Handling
- Always handle async operations with try/catch
- Use proper error boundaries for component errors
- Provide meaningful error messages

## Performance
- Use React.memo for expensive components
- Implement proper dependency arrays in useEffect
- Avoid unnecessary re-renders
