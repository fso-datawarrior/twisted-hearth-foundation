# Complete Deployment Documentation Overhaul

## Problem Analysis

Current documentation has gaps and inconsistencies:
- `InventoryRunBook.md` is outdated (still references `firebase login` and manual deploys)
- No comprehensive setup guide for Workload Identity from scratch
- Missing replication guide for other projects
- No master checklist for validation
- Scattered information across multiple files
- Some docs still reference deprecated FIREBASE_TOKEN approach

## Solution: Create Complete Documentation Suite

### 1. Update/Create Core Documentation Files

**A. Create: `docs/DEPLOYMENT-PROD/WORKLOAD-IDENTITY-SETUP-GUIDE.md`**
- Complete step-by-step guide for Workload Identity setup
- Includes Google Cloud Console screenshots/instructions
- Firebase project configuration requirements
- Service account setup and permissions
- GitHub Actions workflow configuration
- Validation steps and troubleshooting
- **REUSABLE**: Replace project-specific values with placeholders

**B. Create: `docs/DEPLOYMENT-PROD/REPLICATION-GUIDE.md`**
- How to replicate this setup for NEW projects
- Checklist of all prerequisites
- Step-by-step implementation guide
- Configuration file templates
- Testing and validation procedures
- Common pitfalls and solutions

**C. Update: `docs/DEPLOYMENT-PROD/InventoryRunBook.md`**
- Remove deprecated manual deployment instructions
- Add Workload Identity automated deployment section
- Update to reference GitHub Actions workflows
- Add links to daily prompts
- Update troubleshooting for Workload Identity

**D. Create: `docs/DEPLOYMENT-PROD/MASTER-DEPLOYMENT-CHECKLIST.md`**
- Initial setup checklist
- Daily deployment checklist
- Production deployment validation
- Emergency rollback procedures
- Health check procedures

### 2. Create Comprehensive Summary Document

**E. Create: `docs/DEPLOYMENT-PROD/DEPLOYMENT-ARCHITECTURE-OVERVIEW.md`**
- High-level architecture diagram (text-based)
- Authentication flow (Workload Identity)
- Deployment pipeline overview
- Branch strategy explanation
- Environment separation (dev vs prod)
- Security model
- Quick reference links to all docs

### 3. Organize Daily Prompts Section

**F. Update: `docs/DEPLOYMENT-WORKFLOWS/DAILY-PROMPTS/README.md`**
- Add "New to this project?" section
- Link to setup guides
- Clear workflow diagram
- Troubleshooting quick links

### 4. Create Quick Start Guide

**G. Create: `docs/DEPLOYMENT-PROD/QUICKSTART.md`**
- 5-minute overview for new team members
- Links to detailed docs
- Prerequisites checklist
- First deployment walkthrough
- Common commands reference

## Content Requirements for Each New Document

### WORKLOAD-IDENTITY-SETUP-GUIDE.md
1. Prerequisites (Google Cloud account, Firebase project, GitHub repo)
2. Step 1: Create Workload Identity Pool (with exact commands)
3. Step 2: Create OIDC Provider (with attribute mappings)
4. Step 3: Configure Service Account (with IAM bindings)
5. Step 4: Update GitHub Workflows (with full YAML examples)
6. Step 5: Test Authentication (validation steps)
7. Troubleshooting section
8. Security considerations

### REPLICATION-GUIDE.md
1. Overview: "How to set this up for your project"
2. Prerequisites checklist
3. Search-and-replace values list (project ID, org, repo, etc.)
4. File-by-file implementation guide
5. Configuration templates with placeholders
6. Testing procedures
7. Rollback plan
8. Success criteria

### MASTER-DEPLOYMENT-CHECKLIST.md
1. **Initial Setup** (one-time)
   - [ ] Google Cloud Project created
   - [ ] Firebase project initialized
   - [ ] Workload Identity Pool configured
   - [ ] Service account permissions set
   - [ ] GitHub workflows created
   - [ ] First deployment successful

2. **Daily Development** (repeatable)
   - [ ] Branch created/checked out
   - [ ] Changes committed
   - [ ] Dev deployment triggered
   - [ ] Dev site verified

3. **Production Deployment** (end of day)
   - [ ] All changes tested in dev
   - [ ] Merge to prod branch
   - [ ] Production deployment triggered
   - [ ] Production site verified
   - [ ] Rollback plan ready

4. **Emergency Rollback**
   - [ ] Identify last good commit
   - [ ] Revert to last good commit
   - [ ] Force push to prod branch
   - [ ] Verify rollback successful

### DEPLOYMENT-ARCHITECTURE-OVERVIEW.md

   - Hosting (Firebase)
   - Backend (Supabase)
   - Authentication (Workload Identity)

2. Deployment Pipeline
   - Dev branches → Dev environment
   - Prod branch → Production environment
   - GitHub Actions automation

   - Service account permissions
   - Repository restrictions

5. Quick Links to All Documentation

## Validation Steps

After creating all documents:
1. Read through each document for completeness
2. Verify all cross-references are correct
3. Check that project-specific values are clearly marked
4. Ensure replication guide has all necessary placeholders
5. Test checklist against actual deployment process
6. Verify troubleshooting sections are comprehensive
7. Confirm all deprecated content is clearly marked

## Success Criteria

- [ ] All documents created/updated
- [ ] No contradictory information across docs
- [ ] Replication guide tested conceptually
- [ ] Checklists validated against actual process
- [ ] All deprecated content clearly marked
- [ ] Cross-references verified
- [ ] Quick start guide accessible to newcomers
- [ ] Architecture overview provides clear mental model

### To-dos

- [ ] Create UNIFIED-SETUP.md combining both Path A and Path B setup instructions with all project-specific values filled in
- [ ] Create WHICH-PATH-GUIDE.md to help users choose between Path A and Path B for their workday
- [ ] Update RUNBOOK-PathA-devBranchIntoMain.md to remove setup steps and focus on daily workflow only
- [ ] Update RUNBOOK-PathB-devBranch-Live.md to remove setup steps and focus on daily workflow only
- [ ] Create .github/workflows/firebase-hosting.yml with unified workflow supporting pull_request, push, and workflow_dispatch triggers
